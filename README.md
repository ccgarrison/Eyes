# Eyes
## Eyes Exercise
This excercise allows the eyes to follow the cursor.  It is an interactive web page created with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript together.

How to Run: Once the page loads move the cursor around the page and the eyes should follow. You should be able to use on your browser by loading the index.html file.

Future Improvements: Learn more and use the variety of CSS commands. Try and change the eye color or the shape of the eyes.
